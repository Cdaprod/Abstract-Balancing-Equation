# Abstract Balance Equation

## Overview

This project implements a flexible algorithmic approach to balancing three variables across various domains. The core concept is a weighted sum equation that can be adapted to different scenarios, from photography settings to machine learning parameters to 3D printer arm positioning.

## Key Features

- Abstract base class for implementing balance equations
- Customizable normalization functions for each variable
- Flexible weighting system to adjust variable importance
- Optimization method to find ideal parameter combinations
- Extensible design allowing easy adaptation to new use cases

## Use Cases

### 1. Photography: Exposure Triangle

Balances aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to achieve optimal exposure. The implementation uses logarithmic scaling to account for the exponential nature of these settings.

### 2. Machine Learning: Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Optimizes the balance between bias, variance, and computational cost in machine learning models. This can help in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. 3D Printing: Delta Printer Arm Positioning

Calculates the optimal heights for three arms in a delta 3D printer configuration to achieve precise positioning of the print head. This case demonstrates how the abstract concept can be applied to complex mechanical systems.

## Extendibility

The abstract nature of the base class allows for easy extension to new domains. To adapt the equation to a new use case:

1. Subclass the base `BalanceEquation` class
2. Override the normalization methods as needed
3. Implement domain-specific optimization constraints

## Mathematical Foundation

The core equation takes the form:

```
F(A, B, C) = w1 * f(A) + w2 * g(B) + w3 * h(C)
```

Where:
- A, B, C are the variables to be balanced
- w1, w2, w3 are weights determining the relative importance of each variable
- f, g, h are normalization functions for each variable

## Future Directions

- Implement more complex optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent)
- Add support for constraints and boundary conditions
- Develop a user interface for interactive exploration of variable relationships
- Extend to support more than three variables

## Usage

The `abstract.py` file contains the core implementation. To use:

1. Import the relevant classes from `abstract.py`
2. Create a subclass for your specific use case
3. Initialize with appropriate weights
4. Use the `calculate` method to evaluate specific variable combinations
5. Use the `optimize` method to find optimal parameters within given ranges

Refer to the examples in the script for detailed usage patterns.
